 *The exercises were easy and fun. Before that, I used the command line at the "copy-paste command from the Internet" level. Now I understand how it works and I have already used some commands when working with Git.*

 *Articles about HTTP were quite difficult due to the many new terms. So I had to look for additional information all the time. Everything became a little clearer, but I still plan to return to this to understand better.*
