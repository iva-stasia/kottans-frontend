   *I had never studied programming before so everything was new and sometimes not clear. But additional materials and a little time helped to absorb the information.*

___

 [Quiz 4](https://github.com/iva-stasia/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_linux_cli/1_1_4.png)
 
 *The exercises were easy and fun. Before that, I used the command line at the "copy-paste command from the Internet" level. Now I understand how it works and I have already used some commands when working with Git.*

 *Articles about HTTP were quite difficult due to the many new terms. So I had to look for additional information all the time. Everything became a little clearer, but I still plan to return to this to understand better.*

## 2. Git Collaboration

### **Introduction to Git and GitHub**

[Week 4](https://github.com/iva-stasia/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_git_collaboration/3_1_2.png)

*After practicing on the first Git task and learning the command line, the information from the course was much easier to understand. The theory seems clear. I already use some commands when I work with Git and GitHub.*

*After completing the course and studying additional materials, the exercises seemed quite understandable and interesting.*

___
## 3. Intro to HTML and CSS

### **Course HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers**

[Week 1](https://github.com/iva-stasia/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_html_css_intro/4_1_1.png)

[Week 2](https://github.com/iva-stasia/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_html_css_intro/4_1_2.png)

*I have come across HTML and CSS before only in computer science classes. However, I remembered that with the help of these languages we create the structure and style of the site. Therefore, almost everything that I learned from the video was new and understandable at the same time. The course gave me a good theoretical understanding of these languages.*

### **Learn HTML**
### **Learn CSS**

[Progress](https://github.com/iva-stasia/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_html_css_intro/4_2.png)

*Taking courses on Codecademy was much more interesting than just listening to lectures. A big plus of this format is the visibility of changes. Sometimes it was quite boring because of the simplicity of the exercises. Now I feel the need to consolidate the acquired knowledge on more complex practical tasks.*

___
## 4. Responsive Web Design

### **Flexbox**

[Froggy Game](https://github.com/iva-stasia/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_responsive_web_design/froggy_game.png)

*I didn't understand Flexbox right away. I was a little confused that we set some properties to the container and others for children. So I went through the Zombie Flex game to better understand how each property works. Then I found additional information and practiced a little. After that, I figured out this topic and can use it in my projects.*

### **Grid Layout**

[Grid Garden](https://github.com/iva-stasia/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_responsive_web_design/grid_garden.png)

*Grid was easier to understand than Flexbox for me. Although I still use the cheatsheet, because I couldn't remember all the available options, especially the short forms. Now I remember only the most basic ones. I will watch the rest as needed.\
At this step, I also decided to practice on Freecodecamp both in Grid and Flex and in CSS in general. After that, I was able to start the popup task and already used the knowledge gained there.*
