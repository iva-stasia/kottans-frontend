   *I had never studied programming before so everything was new and sometimes not clear. But additional materials and a little time helped to absorb the information.*

 *The exercises were easy and fun. Before that, I used the command line at the "copy-paste command from the Internet" level. Now I understand how it works and I have already used some commands when working with Git.*

 *Articles about HTTP were quite difficult due to the many new terms. So I had to look for additional information all the time. Everything became a little clearer, but I still plan to return to this to understand better.*

## Git Collaboration

**Introduction to Git and GitHub:**

[Week 4](https://github.com/iva-stasia/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_git_collaboration/3_1_2.png)

*After practicing on the first Git task and learning the command line, the information from the course was much easier to understand. The theory seems clear. I already use some commands when I work with Git and GitHub.*
