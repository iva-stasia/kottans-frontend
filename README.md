   *I had never studied programming before so everything was new and sometimes not clear. But additional materials and a little time helped to absorb the information.*

## 1. Linux CLI and HTTP

### **Linux Survival (4 modules)**

 [Quiz 4](https://github.com/iva-stasia/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_linux_cli/1_1_4.png)
 
 *The exercises were easy and fun. Before that, I used the command line at the "copy-paste command from the Internet" level. Now I understand how it works and I have already used some commands when working with Git.*

 *Articles about HTTP were quite difficult due to the many new terms. So I had to look for additional information all the time. Everything became a little clearer, but I still plan to return to this to understand better.*

## 2. Git Collaboration

### **Introduction to Git and GitHub**

[Week 3](https://github.com/iva-stasia/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_git_collaboration/3_1_1.png)

[Week 4](https://github.com/iva-stasia/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_git_collaboration/3_1_2.png)

*After practicing on the first Git task and learning the command line, the information from the course was much easier to understand. The theory seems clear. I already use some commands when I work with Git and GitHub.*

*After completing the course and studying additional materials, the exercises seemed quite understandable and interesting.*

## 3. Intro to HTML and CSS

### **Course HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers**

[Week 1](https://github.com/iva-stasia/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_html_css_intro/4_1_1.png)

[Week 2](https://github.com/iva-stasia/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_html_css_intro/4_1_2.png)

*I have come across HTML and CSS before only in computer science classes. However, I remembered that with the help of these languages we create the structure and style of the site. Therefore, almost everything that I learned from the video was new and understandable at the same time. The course gave me a good theoretical understanding of these languages.*

### **Learn HTML**
### **Learn CSS**

[Progress](https://github.com/iva-stasia/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_html_css_intro/4_2.png)

*Taking courses on Codecademy was much more interesting than just listening to lectures. A big plus of this format is the visibility of changes. Sometimes it was quite boring because of the simplicity of the exercises. Now I feel the need to consolidate the acquired knowledge on more complex practical tasks.*

___

## 4. Responsive Web Design

### **Flexbox**

[Froggy Game](https://github.com/iva-stasia/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_responsive_web_design/froggy_game.png)

*I didn't understand Flexbox right away. I was a little confused that we set some properties to the container and others for children. So I went through the Zombie Flex game to better understand how each property works. Then I found additional information and practiced a little. After that, I figured out this topic and can use it in my projects.*

### **Grid Layout**

[Grid Garden](https://github.com/iva-stasia/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_responsive_web_design/grid_garden.png)

*Grid was easier to understand than Flexbox for me. Although I still use the cheatsheet, because I couldn't remember all the available options, especially the short forms. Now I remember only the most basic ones. I will watch the rest as needed.\
At this step, I also decided to practice on Freecodecamp both in Grid and Flex and in CSS in general. After that, I was able to start the popup task and already used the knowledge gained there.*

## 5. HTML & CSS Practice

[Demo](https://iva-stasia.github.io/html-css-popup/) | [Code base](https://github.com/iva-stasia/html-css-popup)

*This is my first HTML and CSS project.\
The most valuable thing for me is the experience of solving the problems that I encountered while completing the task.*
___

## 6. JS Basics

### **Introduction to JS**

[Introduction to JS](https://github.com/iva-stasia/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_js_basics/coursera_intro_js.png)

*This is my first exposure to JS, so I started with a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxgOKJh4zWE) from another author who teaches more clearly to me. Also studied the basic topics in the [book](https://uk.javascript.info/). After that, I watched this course to consolidate my knowledge.*

### **FreeCodeCamp exercises**

[Functional Programming](https://github.com/iva-stasia/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_js_basics/functional_programming.png)

[Algorithm Scripting Challenges](https://github.com/iva-stasia/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_js_basics/algorithm_scripting.png)

*At first, it was pretty hard. It took a while to get used to the syntax. Therefore, in addition, I took a basic JS course on Codecademy, as it seemed to me much easier. But when I did the exercises at FreeCodeCamp it was very exciting. The most pleasant thing in JS is the ability to solve problems in different ways and find solutions. The most interesting exercises were in Intermediate Algorithm Scripting. I don't yet know how to combine this knowledge with the previous ones, so I'm very interested in starting the next task.*
